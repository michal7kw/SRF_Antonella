YAF Binding Analysis Summary
============================

Number of upregulated genes analyzed: 3371
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for upregulated genes: -0.505 ± 0.703 (mean ± SD)

Number of downregulated genes analyzed: 1843
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for downregulated genes: 0.328 ± 0.750 (mean ± SD)

Wilcoxon rank sum test for difference in YAF/GFP enrichment:

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  log2FC_binding by regulation
W = 4987879, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0


Conclusion:
YAF binding is significantly higher at promoters of downregulated genes compared to upregulated genes.
This supports the hypothesis that YAF binding to promoters may cause gene downregulation, suggesting a repressive function.

Correlation between YAF binding and gene expression:

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  all_signal$log2FC_binding and all_signal$log2FC_expr
t = -34.638, df = 5212, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.4543832 -0.4102468
sample estimates:
       cor 
-0.4325741 


There is a significant negative correlation between YAF binding and gene expression,
suggesting that stronger YAF binding is associated with lower gene expression.
