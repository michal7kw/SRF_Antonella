YAF Binding Analysis Summary (Filtered for YAF/SOX Intersection Genes)
======================================================================

Analysis restricted to genes present in: /beegfs/scratch/ric.broccoli/kubacki.michal/SRF_H2AK119Ub_cross_V5/1_find_gene_lists_intersections/output/YAF_SOX.csv
Total genes in list: 7354
Genes from list found in DESeq results: 5869

Number of upregulated genes analyzed: 227
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for upregulated genes: -0.071 ± 0.599 (mean ± SD)

Number of downregulated genes analyzed: 459
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for downregulated genes: 0.546 ± 0.632 (mean ± SD)

Wilcoxon rank sum test for difference in YAF/GFP enrichment:

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  log2FC_binding by regulation
W = 79306, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0


Conclusion:
(Note: Conclusions apply only to the subset of genes shared between YAF and SOX targets)
Within the YAF/SOX gene set, YAF binding is significantly higher at promoters of downregulated genes compared to upregulated genes.
This supports the hypothesis that for these shared target genes, YAF binding to promoters may cause gene downregulation, suggesting a repressive function.

Correlation between YAF binding and gene expression:

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  all_signal$log2FC_binding and all_signal$log2FC_expr
t = -11.91, df = 684, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.4745703 -0.3504537
sample estimates:
       cor 
-0.4144372 


There is a significant negative correlation between YAF binding and gene expression,
suggesting that stronger YAF binding is associated with lower gene expression.
