YAF Binding Analysis Summary (Filtered for Genes with YAF & SES Promoter Peaks)
================================================================================

Analysis restricted to genes whose promoters overlap with both YAF peaks (from D:/Github/SRF_H2AK119Ub_cross_V5/DATA/5_peak_calling) and SES peaks (from D:/Github/SRF_H2AK119Ub_cross_V5/SRF_SES_V5/data_from_ncbi_corrected/peaks/SES).
Total promoters defined: 62666
Promoters overlapping YAF peaks: 35119
Promoters overlapping SES peaks: 4031
Promoters overlapping BOTH YAF and SES peaks: 3251
Corresponding unique gene IDs: 3251

Genes from intersection found in DESeq results: 2525
Significant DEGs (padj<0.05, |log2FC|>1) among these: 434

Number of upregulated genes analyzed: 250
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for upregulated genes: 0.029 ± 0.596 (mean ± SD)

Number of downregulated genes analyzed: 184
Mean YAF/GFP enrichment (log2FC) for downregulated genes: 0.687 ± 0.653 (mean ± SD)

Wilcoxon rank sum test for difference in YAF/GFP enrichment:

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  log2FC_binding by regulation
W = 10339, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0


Conclusion (YAF/SES subset):
Within the YAF/SES co-bound gene set, YAF binding is significantly higher at promoters of downregulated genes compared to upregulated genes.
This suggests that for these co-target genes, YAF binding to promoters may be associated with gene downregulation.

Correlation between YAF binding and gene expression (YAF/SES subset):

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  log2FC_binding and log2FC_expr
t = -10.014, df = 432, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.5074503 -0.3544058
sample estimates:
       cor 
-0.4340545 


There is a significant negative correlation between YAF binding and gene expression (r=-0.434).
